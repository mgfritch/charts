              - Ensure all container images have repository and tag on the same level to ensure that all container images are included in rancher-images.txt which are used by airgap customers.
              <pre>
              Ex:-
                engine:
                  # -- Repository for the Longhorn Engine image.
                  repository: rancher/mirrored-longhornio-longhorn-engine
                  # -- Specify Longhorn engine image tag
                  tag: v1.6.2
              </pre>
              - Add a üëç (thumbs up) reaction to this comment once done. CI won't pass without this reaction to the github-action bot's latest validation comment.
              - Approve the PR to run the CI check.`
